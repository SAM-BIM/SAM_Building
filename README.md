**SAM_Building** is part of the **SAM (Sustainable Analytical Model) Toolkit** —  
an open-source collection of tools designed to help engineers create, manage,
and process analytical building models for energy and environmental analysis.

This repository was created as an **experimental space for building-level abstractions**
within the SAM ecosystem.
It explored approaches for representing buildings and their composition
at a higher semantic level than core analytical geometry.

At present, this repository is **not actively used** and should be considered
**experimental and inactive**.
Its contents are retained for reference and potential future development.
